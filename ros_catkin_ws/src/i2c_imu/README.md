i2c_imu
=======

ROS driver for several 9-DOF IMUs.  This node is a ROS interface for [RTIMULib](https://github.com/richards-tech/RTIMULib) by [richards-tech](http://richardstechnotes.wordpress.com/), a C++ library of drivers & filters of operating I2C IMUs in linux.  I take no credit for RTIMULib (the hard part), I simply created a ROS interface to it (the easy part).

The list of IMUs supported by RTIMULib is as follows:

- [MPU-9250 by Invensense](http://www.invensense.com/mems/gyro/mpu9250.html)
